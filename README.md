# Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree

##P0:Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data
**You’ll download Anaconda and use a Jupyter Notebook to analyze bike rental data. It’s a great project to tackle during the first week in your Nanodegree to see if the program is a good fit for you!**

## P1:Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
**Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results. Use the Statistics Placement Advisor to determine if reviewing any of the Statistics course will help you prepare for this project.**

## P2:Investigate a Dataset
**Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.**

## P3:Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
**Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project.**

## P5:Fraud Detection in Enron Dataset
**Detect person of interest i.e. probable poeple who might have committed the fruad. The dataset is limited and challenging and has to depend on feature scaling and extraction to achieve the required target**
